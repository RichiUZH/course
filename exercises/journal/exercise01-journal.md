# Lab Journal: Exercise 1

Authors: Stohler Robin, name surname

This is your lab journal. Use it to protocol what you did (even if it did not work) and to describe how you tried to solve the exercise. In case an experiment did not turn out as expected, describe what you did, what you expected to happen, and what actually happened.

This file is in markdown format and rendered nicely in the web. See [this link](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for further information about how markdown works.


As a first approach the given code was used to find a convergence point. As Far as I tested the maximum utility is somewhere around 0.5313999999999999 work time either working more or working less results in a decreased utility.

After maximizing the Utility function a global maximum was found at 0.53125 as we can see with the try and error approach we got very close to the actual maximum.
