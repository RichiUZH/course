# Exercise 8 - Market Making

As discussed in the lecture, the market maker faces a non-trivial control problem. Its job is to provide liquidity to the market without going bankrupt. It has privileged access to the market, as the normal traders are not allowed to place limit orders, and thus always have to trade with a market maker. However, there might be multiple market makers competing with each other. 

## Task

Try to make the class [MarketMaking](../src/com/agentecon/exercise8/MarketMaking.java) pass the unit test [MarketMakingTest](../src/com/agentecon/exercise8/MarketMakingTest.java). The grading will be based on the following criteria:

* How many tests does your class pass?
* Is the code well-structured and non-obvious ideas documented? (See also the slides on documentation and clean code.)
* Did you think on your own or did you just copy things from me?

Next week, we will also run these in competition with each other, and see how well your algorithms do in the simulation. However, this is not graded so you can focus on making it work under the testing conditions.

## Deliverables and deadline

The only deliverable this time is a 

The deadline for submitting the lab journal to github is 2017-11-09 at 24:00.
