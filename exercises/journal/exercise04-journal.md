## Task 1: Savings Rule

>### PAYGO vs Funded System
>As the given task dictates, we assume that the modeled economy can not rely on a PAYGO system (pay as you go, or _Umlaufverfahren_ in German). Instead, the agents count on a funded system (_Kapitaldeckungsverfahren_). In this system, every agent saves a portion of his income; sets it aside while subjecting it to interest (for example a savings account or ideally with interest rates higher than inflation, such as a pension fund); and finances his existence in retirement. As long as interest rates are higher than the population growth rate, the funded system performs better, with respect to lifetime income, than a PAYGO system.

Agents are prohibited from working during their retirement. As shown (_WO? ERKLÄRUNG / BEWEIS CONSUMPTION SMOOTHING SYBILLA_) they should aim to save a portion of the fruits of their labor, dedicated to consumption during this last period of their life. In accordance with the No-Ponzi condition, the capital of every agent must be non-negative at the end of his life cycle. There is no inheritance system in place and the agent derives no utility from owning money at the point of his death (as maybe would be the case in real life, leaving one's assets to an institution, such as a charity or school). Therefore, this share (combined with any interest it accumulates during his time as a worker and over the remaining 100 days of his life) should be consumed completely before the agent's demise.
